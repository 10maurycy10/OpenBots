# Open DArrows Bots

A not so simple node js program to bot a darrows server.

configs are in config.js

## configuring

the configs can be set with env vars. The configs are json, so strings need to wraped in both single and double qoutes:

```
ADDRESS='"wss://darrows.zerotixdev.repl.co"' ...
```

the most important config is ADDRESS, it should be set to "wss://darrows.zerotixdev.repl.co/" to bot the server.

## running

run ```npm start``` after configuring the bot.

the configs can be set with env vars.
